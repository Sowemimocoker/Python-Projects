Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

I used Python codes below used to create BMI calculator

height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# 

#
bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)
